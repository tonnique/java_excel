This project was done by me for two reasons: 

  a) I wanted to learn how to read data from Excel and write data to Excel using Java. I did not complete such tasks before. After some searching I found that i can use apache.poi library.<br>
  b) This project I did in hope that I will be given a freelance job. I was hesiteting that I can work around Excel using Java, so i needed to try myself before sent proposal.

The freelance job has been closed and I did not get it. But the work i done, was not in vain, i got new cool skills.

Here i am going to leave the text of freelance job announcement in order when I come here again in some months or years and need to remind what i did here. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE JAVA PROGRAM & SOURCES FROM THIS LINK:  http://www.filedropper.com/java

I need a modification to the attached Java program. The GUI will have a check field called "Filter". 
The "Filter" function will be interlinked with the "Modify' function (Modify button) which already exists in the program. If the "Filter" option is checked and the "Modify" button is clicked, the program will filter out data from the text file and transfer it to the excel file. 

The path field for the text file is already in the GUI which is the SECOND field. You will setup a new path field for the Excel file. The excel file may already have some data in it so do NOT overwrite old data. Populate new data just below the old data. 

The data that will be filtered out from the text file and transferred to the Excel file must meet this condition: 

	If the value in the field "tracking-number" is 15 characters or less or blank then remove the entire row from the text file and put in the excel file.

The following fields will be transferred to the excel file and the remaining fields will be ignored.

order-id (example 111-6596742-0953827)
order-item-id (example 43490944910450)
payments-date (example 2018-08-12 ADD T01:08:42-07:00 to all values, so the value will be 2018-08-12T01:08:42-07:00)
ship-date (this field will be blank)
notes (this field will be blank)

I have attached the sample excel file for your reference. I have also populated the excel file with some random data as an example.

Thanks.
